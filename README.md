# Ckomop0x.me blog website

Personal blog website. It uses NextJS, Strapi, TypeScript, GraphQL and other technologies. It has many good optimisations under the hood.

**[https://ckomop0x.me](https://ckomop0x.me)**

## How it works

### Backend

I use Strapi as headless CMS and gather data via GraphQL.

### Frontend

For the client I use NextJS and Apollo, each deploy it gets the newest data via GraphqQL.
TypeScript types are generated during deployment. They are based on schema and queries.

For automatization, I use GitHub actions and Netlify deploy.
Strict policies allows deploying to `prod` only from `master` and it's possible to push to
`master` or merge PR only if tests are ‚úÖ passing and everything is `ok` with build/deploy
to Netlify.
